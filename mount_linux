# Options for fstab
Auto: The file system will be mounted at boot time, automatically.
Noauto: The file system is only mounted when you enter the mount -a command.
Exec: The execution of binaries is allowed on this file system.
Noexec: The execution of binaries is not allowed on this file system.
Ro: The file system should be mounted as read-only.
Rw: The file system should be mounted as read-write.
Sync: File writes should be conducted immediately and not buffered. Best reserved for floppy disks, if anyone is still using them. Incurs a performance penalty.
Async: File writes should be buffered and optimized.
User: Any user is allowed to mount the file system.
Nouser: The root user is the only user who can mount this file system.
Defaults: This is a shorthand way of specifying a set of common settings: (rw, suid, dev, exec, auto, nouser, and async).
Suid: Allows the operation of the suid and sgid bits. The suid bit is used to allow a file to be executed as root, by a normal user, without giving the user full root privileges. When the sgid bit is set on a directory, files and directories created within that directory have their group ownership set to that of the directory, not to the group of the user who created them.
Nosuid: Do not permit the use of the suid and sgid bits.
Noatime: - Do not update the file access times on the file system. This can help performance on old hardware.
Nodiratime: Do not update the directory access times on the file system.
Relatime: Update file access times relative to the file modified time.
